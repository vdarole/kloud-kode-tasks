There is some data on App Server 3 in Stratos DC. The Nautilus development team shared some requirement with the DevOps team to alter some of the data as per recent changes. The DevOps team is working to prepare a Puppet programming file to accomplish this. Below you can find more details about the task.
Create a Puppet programming file demo.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on Puppet master node i.e Jump Server and by using puppet file_line resource perform the following tasks.
We have a file /opt/sysops/demo.txt on App Server 3. Use the Puppet programming file mentioned above to replace line Welcome to Nautilus Industries! to Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!, no other data should be altered in this file.

Solution:  

1. Go through the folder mentioned in task and create puppet files
root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# cat demo.pp class data_replacer {
  file_line { 'line_replace' :
  path => '/opt/sysops/demo.txt',
  match => 'Welcome to Nautilus Industries!',
  line => 'Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!',
  }
}
node 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {
  include data_replacer
}

2. Validate the puppet files by below command.
root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# puppet parser validate demo.pp

3. Login on App server  stapp03 & check the file 
[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /opt/sysops/demo.txt
This is Nautilus sample file, created using Puppet !
Welcome to Nautilus Industries!
Please do not modify this file manually!

4. Run Puppet agent to pull the configuration from puppet server 
[root@stapp02 ~]# puppet agent -tv

5. Validate the task by running cat /opt/sysops/demo.txt
[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /opt/sysops/demo.txt
This is Nautilus sample file, created using Puppet !
Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!
Please do not modify this file manually!
[root@stapp02 ~]#
