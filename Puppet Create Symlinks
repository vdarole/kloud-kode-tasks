Some directory structure in the Stratos Datacenter needs to be changed, there is a directory that needs to be linked to the default Apache document root. We need to accomplish this task using Puppet, as per the instructions given below:
Create a puppet programming file demo.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. Within that define a class symlink and perform below mentioned tasks:
Create a symbolic link through puppet programming code. The source path should be /opt/security and destination path should be /var/www/html on Puppet agents 2 i.e on App Servers 2.
Create a blank file story.txt under /opt/security directory on puppet agent 2 nodes i.e on App Servers 2.

Solution:
1. Login to puppet server and write the below manifest. 

root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# cat demo.pp 
class dir {
 file { '/opt/security':
  ensure   => 'link',
  target   => '/var/www/html',
  }
 file { '/opt/security/story.txt':
  ensure => 'present',  
  }
}

node 'stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {
  include dir
}

2. validate the manifest.
root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests#  puppet parser validate demo.pp

3. login to App server and perform puppet agent test. 
[root@stapp02 ~]# puppet agent -tv

4. Check the output. 

[root@stapp02 ~]# ls -l /opt/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   13 Jul 21 15:11 security -> /var/www/html

[root@stapp02 ~]# ls -l /opt/security/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 21 15:11 story.txt
